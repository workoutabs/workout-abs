I read a guide to IVF online on fertility friends i think and it said to avoid exercise after IUI or IVF as the exercise pumps blood around the body away from the womb which doesnt help as that area needs.</p>

<p>Can you exercise after IUI G_S I moderately exercise however when I went to RE on CD 14 for US the nurse asked me not to exercise as it could interrupt with my ovulation or maybe because I had a big folli 32 mm. After the first one which failed I went home and did my normal 30-45 spin class. I read a guide to IVF online on fertility friends i think and it said to avoid exercise after IUI or IVF as the exercise pumps blood around the body away from the womb which doesnt help as that area needs. Can you exercise after IUI G_S I moderately exercise however when I went to RE on CD 14 for US the nurse asked me not to exercise as it could interrupt with my ovulation or maybe because I had a big folli 32 mm. Second IUI today. According to the info my clinic gives out I can keep my normal exercise routine post-iui. Pin On Womanhood.</p>
