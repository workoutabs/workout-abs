<p>The key in this variation of rest-pause training is hitting failure at several points in the same set. Basically one set may be two minutes long with little 10-second breaks taken within the set. That means you go until cant get another full rep with good form. For instance in the first workout day of Week One - where I have a set of squats for 20 reps and a set for 50 reps - I would personally do 5 or 6 warm-up sets of progressively heavier weights before attempting that first death set.
